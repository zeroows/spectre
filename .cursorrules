# Cursor Rules - Context7 Required

## MANDATORY: Always Use Context7

**CRITICAL RULE**: Before answering any question, implementing any feature, or solving any problem, you MUST use Context7 to look up relevant documentation and best practices.

### When to Use Context7

1. **Before implementing any feature**: Always search Context7 for library documentation, examples, and best practices
2. **When encountering errors**: Use Context7 to find solutions and troubleshooting guides
3. **When using external libraries**: Always fetch library documentation via Context7 before using APIs
4. **When optimizing code**: Search Context7 for performance best practices and patterns
5. **When designing architecture**: Consult Context7 for design patterns and architectural guidance

### How to Use Context7

1. **Resolve library ID first**: Use `mcp_context7_resolve-library-id` to find the correct library identifier
2. **Fetch documentation**: Use `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` with the resolved library ID
3. **Apply best practices**: Use the documentation to inform your implementation
4. **Cite sources**: Reference the Context7 documentation when explaining your approach

### Example Workflow

```
User asks: "How do I implement X?"
1. Use Context7 to resolve library ID for relevant library
2. Fetch documentation with specific topic
3. Review examples and best practices
4. Implement solution based on Context7 documentation
5. Explain approach referencing Context7 sources
```

### Prohibited Behavior

- ❌ DO NOT implement features without consulting Context7 first
- ❌ DO NOT guess API usage - always look it up via Context7
- ❌ DO NOT skip Context7 even for "simple" questions
- ❌ DO NOT use outdated patterns - always check Context7 for current best practices

### Exception

The ONLY exception is when Context7 is explicitly unavailable or the user explicitly requests to skip it. Otherwise, Context7 usage is MANDATORY.

## Project-Specific Rules

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Dioxus 0.7.1
- **Language**: Rust
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Platform**: Web (WASM)

### Code Style
- Use Rust naming conventions (snake_case for functions, PascalCase for types)
- Prefer explicit types over type inference when it improves readability
- Use `use_signal`, `use_memo`, `use_effect` hooks appropriately
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Organize code into separate component files

### Component Organization
- Components should be in `src/components/` directory
- Each component should be in its own file
- Use `mod.rs` to re-export components
- Pass signals and event handlers as props

### Best Practices
- Always handle async operations with `spawn` and proper error handling
- Use debouncing for expensive operations
- Cache expensive computations (like scrypt key derivation)
- Provide visual feedback for loading states
- Ensure accessibility with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
